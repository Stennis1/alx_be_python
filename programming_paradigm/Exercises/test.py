Practice Exercises
Exercise 1: Understanding the Importance of Testing

Instruction:

Write a small Python function (e.g., a function to calculate the square of a number) and intentionally introduce a bug (e.g., incorrect calculation logic).
Exercise 2: Writing Basic Unit Tests

Instruction:

Use the unittest module in Python to create a test case for the buggy function from Exercise 1.
Write test methods to check different scenarios (e.g., valid input, invalid input) and verify expected behavior.
